= Pivotal CF Mobile Services Field Demo

This document outlines the steps required to demo Pivotal Cloud Foundry Mobile Services using the Transit Application.

=== The Transit Mobile App
The Transit App is a sample mobile application which shows the public transportation routes for the city of Toronto. 
This app combines the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform with the Pivotal Mobile Services, namely Data Sync, Push Notification
and Api Gateway to give a mobile user the ability to create bus routes of interest and receive push notifications based on 
predictions. The transit application consist of the following components.

==== Transit iOS App
The transit iOS mobile app authenicates users after launch using the data synch authenication service and then retrieves
existing saved bus routes from the data synch mobile service.

==== Transit Sample API Gateway
The transit sample API gateway application makes external web service calls to the NextBus web service and performs XML->JSON
translation. This application is deployed into Pivotal Cloud Foundry into an organization and space is and bound to the API Gateway
service.

==== Transit Sample Scheduler
The transit sample scheduler application is a ruby based application that reviews the stop predictions and sends push notifications
to mobile users that registered with those bus routes.

==== NextBus Web Service

routes, service alerts and predictions. It is used by the API Gateway to retrieve service information about mobile user routes.
