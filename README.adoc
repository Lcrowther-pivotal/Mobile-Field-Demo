== Material Format Philosophy

* *Presentations* introduce concepts.  They should not provide detail and never reformat the same content available on the docs site as bullets.  Heavily bulleted presentations tend to be boring so we favor animation.  Well rehearsed animation illustrates and explains concepts with very few words (see Onsiâ€™s talk on Diego at link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OkmVTFhfLY[CF Summit]).
+
*Note*: Powerpoint versions of the presentations are included.  These are exported from Keynote and may have formatting issues.
+

* *Docs* are for detail.  Students should get in the habit of reading and referring to the docs site.  Open book "quizzes" in the curriculum help ensure students read the docs.

* *Asciidoc* docs in git define the course, links and work.  They are easy to edit, format and navigate.
