= Pivotal CF Mobile Services Field Demo

This document outlines the steps required to demo Pivotal Cloud Foundry Mobile Services using the Transit Application.

=== The Transit Mobile App
The Transit App is a sample mobile application which shows the public transportation routes for the city of Toronto. 
This app combines the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform with the Pivotal Mobile Services, namely Data Sync, Push Notification
and Api Gateway to give a mobile user the ability to create bus routes of interest and receive push notifications based on 
predictions. The transit application consist of the following components:

==== Transit Application
The transit mobile application provides a simple way to register for bus routes of interest and receive notifications when
a route is predicted to route late. The application authenicates users after launch using the data synch authenication service 
and retrieves existing user-saved bus routes from the data synch mobile service. There is native applicaiton for iOS and Android
devices. 

==== Transit Sample API Gateway
The transit sample API gateway application makes external web service calls to the NextBus web service and performs XML->JSON
translation. This application is deployed into Pivotal Cloud Foundry into an organization and space is and bound to the API Gateway
service. The demo environment already has this application deployed.

==== Transit Sample Scheduler
The transit sample scheduler application is a ruby based application that reviews the stop predictions and sends push notifications
to mobile users that registered with those bus routes. The demo environment already has this application deployed.

==== NextBus Web Service
link:http://www.nextbus.com/predictor/stopSelector.jsp?a=ttc[NextBus] is a thrid party web service which delivers a list of bus
routes, service alerts and predictions. It is used by the API Gateway to retrieve service information about mobile user routes.
